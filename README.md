# F1Program
Works rn but doesnt predict anything properly so not even remotely closed to finished

Things I want to do:
  1. Add something about track history - done
  2. Compare it to actual results
  3. Look at the efficiency of their results see if its better or worse than expected
  4. Start using objects and OOP
  5. Make spiffy
  6. Find a way to put down all values and check the efficiency of each race at once
